# Vision Transformer Transfer Learning Project Repository

Full step-by-step instructions for reproducability can be found on the .ipynb file and in the final report. GitHub is unable to hold the final parameter weights saved in a .pth file as the final file is too large. 

As most of the work was done on Google Colab, a link to the Google Drive directory where most of the work was completed can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r3ySHyhwe-7gG5cKfgGHa26_aS0MOnik

The Google Drive directory contains: 
* The ipynb file openable with Google Colab
* The final parameter weights, saved as `vit_l_16_100epochs.pth` and `vit_l_16_100epochs_ft.pth` (1.14 GB)
* The project's panel progress report presentation
* The original train and testing data
